Everyone has their own version of philosophy in their life. And there is nothing right or wrong in any of the version. It is just how that person sees the world from his/her glasses. I also believe in some such values. And one of them is that &#8211; _Purpose of a human life is to be happy._&nbsp;And I strongly believe in it. But things happened and I deviated from this purpose, and that too for quite long.<!--more-->

## What happened

In November of 2017, I got injured and fractured my left shoulder during sports. It was sad that such thing happened. But what was more sad was that just one week before that I bought some gym training sessions as I wanted to achieve some fitness goals. But now the whole equation had changed. For next 6~8 months I was advised to stay away from gym and rather concentrate on physiotherapy to heal my shoulder. I got a lot of support from my family, friends and office and I was allowed to work from India (my home) for 3 months. In start of March 2018, when I was back to Singapore suddenly nothing was feeling normal. Be it SG friends, office, colleagues, food, climate, or any other thing was just feeling very different and that too in a negative way. I started to feel as if I am again trying to adjust to a &#8216;new&#8217; environment. There was some sort of friction all around. Things that used to happen effortlessly, now needed insane effort.

Initially I thought it is just because I was at home for so long that I feel so different. But as few weeks passed, things started to become worse. I started to feel more tensed, worried, lost, insecure, low on energy, irritated, jealous and sad. That was so not me ! The whole world started to feel tinted blue. Situation was not improving at all and I started to feel more sad. I was unable to &#8211;&nbsp; focus at work, make a smooth conversation with people around, reciprocate to friends & family. And then came the change which I do not remember experiencing before &#8211; intermittent sleep loss. I was waking up every hour or two with some tension or anxiety. I do not remember experiencing issues with my sleep before. I am an early-to-bed-early-to-rise kind of person with a very sound sleep (I had the super-natural power to even sleep in a movie theatre). By now, I had realised that something was not right. I was just not sure what has happened.

It would not be an exaggeration, if I would say that during May my mind was filled with negative feelings and thoughts for 90% of the time I was awake.&nbsp;I started to have conflicts with a lot of people around (at least 8 I know :/ ). It is at this point for the first time when I reached out to my father and few very close friends for help. In a few days, it came out that what I was understanding as sadness was actually a _form of depression_ which could be triggered from an incident in one&#8217;s life. For people who are ignorant like I was then, can search online about the difference between grief and depression and will know how each is very different. The kind and severity of depression I was undergoing was an average one. No points for guessing, major reason which triggered this was my shoulder fracture.

Being an&nbsp; [Campaigner](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality)&nbsp;(ENFP) its a part of my nature to speak out whatever I think or feel. But the combination of having such inconsistent and fluctuating feelings and being an extrovert does not go very well. Lot of things started to happen because of this. Some of my family members and friends started to think that I am acting weird, some started to think that I got an attitude problem, some unfollowed me on fb and do not know what all. But a very few of them understood that probably I am undergoing some trouble. They understood that this is not the Siddharth they know. I received unconditional support from them.

## Then ?

After about 80+ days of sleepless nights and this tough phase, things started to improve in August. I had already been trying to do a lot of things to improve things. A few of things that worked for me are:

  * I slowly started with exercising again. Early mornings I started to go for a small run.
  * On the way to my office I started to meditate using this awesome app called [headspace](https://www.headspace.com). Unfortunately, I was not very consistent with this. So benefits were not a lot but still it helped.
  * Increased frequency of discussions with my dad and those friends about this.
  * I shared about this situation with my manager and informed him of my ongoing lack of focus on work. Even though it was not visible since I was doing just enough work (with no proactiveness) but telling about this from my side to him I felt a bit satisfied. Else I would have had a guilt with in. And his reciprocation to my current situation was very warm. I can not forget that day !
  * Started to convince my mind that the indifferent and different behaviour of some people around me was due to my condition. And once I am completely healed, they would also be normal or would at least understand why was I like that.

Among all these things, physical exercise was the main ingredient for recovery while all other points were catalyst to increase its speed. As of the time of writing this blog, I would say I had already recovery 90%. Measuring this was in the same way I measured the problem &#8211; my sleep pattern, focus on work and thoughts running in&nbsp; mind.

## So &#8230;

So now when I have more or less recovered I feel I can tell about this. When I was already facing this situation I did not feel comfortable telling about this to anyone because I thought that instead of support I might get sympathy. And sympathy would be the last thing someone would want in hard times.&nbsp;

My world is very small, may be somewhat around 20 or so (see a section of my world in the below pic). To me these are the ones that matter. And this write-up is also an effort to open up to them and explain about why the things were how they were. It might also have taken some of you by surprise. You all might not have seen the best of me during last few months. I&nbsp;apologise to all of you if I have directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally hurt you. I am sorry !

Also for a bigger audience I would like to tell that anyone could be affected by depression. Things happens and they are not under our control. But what is under our control is how we react to it. If you are not feeling okay, take help, talk to your family or friend or partner or who ever is close to you. Life after all is not a utopian dream, where there is no pain. On the contrary, it is these things that define it. I do not find a better way to conclude than giving the lines by&nbsp;_Robert Frost&nbsp;_&#8211; &#8220;_In three words I can sum up everything about life: it goes on._&#8220;
