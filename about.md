&#8220;_If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all_&#8221; &#8211;Â Michelangelo

I am Siddharth (a.k.a. Sid / Goel), a _Software Engineer_ and tech enthusiast. I recently completed _Masters_ in _Computer Science_ from _<a href="http://nus.edu/" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>_Â and currently working as a Software Engineer in a swiss-based software firm named _<a href="http://adnovum.ch/" target="_blank">AdNovum</a>_.

In my free time I love to play badminton (I am really crazy about it ðŸ˜› ). Most of my time I love to spend in learning some new stuff , writing some code, solving some algorithmic problem or sometime ethical hacking. Last year,Â I was able to hack the email server of NUS SoC and delete any person&#8217;s email. I responsibly reported this bug to concerned department who promptly fixed it.

Helping people in need is another thing that interests me.Â Although I am far from excelling in any field yet but the ideaÂ of building an expertise in the work one does, excites me.
